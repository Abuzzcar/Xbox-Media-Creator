# Xbox-Media-Creator
A GUI version of my Xbox Media Creator built using Visual Basic.

# Features
- Formats Selected Drive to NTFS
- Creates directories suitable for RetroArch
- Gives the drive "ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES" permissions, so it should work on an Xbox in Developer Mode

# Be careful with the drive you format!
- Make sure you check that you are formatting the right drive!
- The C: Drive is exempt to prevent the possibility of the windows partition being formatted.

⚠️ By installing it, you take responsibility for the drives that are formatted, therefore needing to be careful as you could accidentally format the wrong drive if not done properly ⚠️

# Requirements
- Must have .NET 6.0, might not work otherwise
- Should be run with Administrator priviliges as it uses PowerShell processes and cmd.exe processes
